# spotifyPlaylistExporter

Python script for exporting Spotify playlists into textfiles.

## Summary

I wrote this script since I wanted to export my Spotify playlists into textfiles on a regular basis. It was pair programmed with a friend as a way for him to teach me Python which I'm new to.

## Dependencies

**python3** and **python3-requests**.

## Configuration

Edit config.ini and change the examples to fit your environment. Windows users will need to use forwardslashes (/) instead of the typical backslashes when specifying a path in output_folder. If you need help figuring out your client_id, client_secret and refresh_token you can use this blog post as guidance https://benwiz.com/blog/create-spotify-refresh-token/. When you're done editing the config you should be ready to invoke main.py!
