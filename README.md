# spotifyPlaylistExporter

Python script for exporting Spotify playlists into textfiles.

## Summary

I wrote this script since I wanted to export my Spotify playlists into text files on a regular basis. It was pair programmed with a friend as a way for him to teach me Python which I'm new to.

## Dependencies

**python3** and **python3-requests**.

## Configuration

Edit config.py and change the examples to fit your environment. If you are using Windows you will need to use forwardslashes (/) when specifying a path in "OUTPUTDIRECTORY". If you need help figuring out your client_id, client_secret and refresh_token you can use this blog post as guidance https://benwiz.com/blog/create-spotify-refresh-token/.
